Description: This package provides a monetary dictionary and appropriate function to measure the latent dimension in central bank communications. The dictionary is a `quanteda` dictionary object with two dimensions, *dovish* and *hawkish*. The innovation of this dictionary is that it contains appropriate valence shifters where they are applicable, thus minimizing false positives.
